# KF_Incursion_Modding_Example
This is a uproject for a project, that loads an example mod\
To use this get unreal engine 4.15, and optionally repak (it's faster and easier to use than unreal engine's packer)\
Package this project for win64, then you can go to the uprojects, saved/cooked folder to get the content you want to cook\
Note, you don't want to package any physics asssets or skeletal meshes for this example mod, it's just so it references the game's originals in the same place\
